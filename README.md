## INTRODUCTION
The first thing you need to know about phishing scams is that it's not the same as hacking. Phishing scams are all about tricking people into giving up their personal information, like credit card numbers or online banking passwords, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an email or text message.

It's called "phishing" because the criminals are fishing for your sensitive data from behind a computer screen. It only takes one click on the wrong link for everything you care about-your cash, contacts, photos-to be gone forever!

## ðŸ“Œ Types of Email Phishing
1. ### Spear Phishing - Spear phishing is a kind of phishing attack that targets one person (or company) in particular. Spear phishing is often used in ransomware attacks, where someone holding your files hostage sends you an email pretending to be from a reputable company like your internet service provider or antivirus software telling you that your computer is infected with malware. If you click on the link in the email it will take you to a fake website that looks legitimate so when you enter your email address and password to "scan" your computer, you just gave the criminal access to all of your accounts.
2.###  CEO fraud - CEO fraud is a kind of spear-phishing that targets specific people, usually by spoofing high-profile or wealthy individuals. The criminal sends you an email pretending to be from the CEO of your company and asking for money. For example, they might ask you to wire some money to a new bank account and then provide instructions on how to do so. People who are less familiar with the company might fall for this or if it's sent to you from someone who looks legitimate, like the real CEO.
